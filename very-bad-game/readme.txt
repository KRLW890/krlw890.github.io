This is a very old game of mine. I only uploaded this here to show some friends. Please
spare yourself (and me!) and don't play this game if you're just randomly stumbling upon this.
Please.


The main instructions are available in-game.  This document is mainly to explain tips and
tricks (although I would definitely recommend reading instructions!).

    **LAUNCHING:
Here's a link where you can play it. Please don't.
https://krlw890.github.io/very-bad-game/Title%20Here.html
This game was made for Google Chrome. Using another browser could affect the visuals, audio,
and/or gameplay. If you want to play this game (which, again, I do not recommend), then use
Chrome.


    **GLITCHES:
If you get to a point where you need to type, you might find that backspace does not work.
This is because Chrome uses the backspace as a hotkey for the back button. This extension
should fix it:

If you are still having trouble, the delete key is programmed to work as a replacement
for backspace.


    **TRICKS:
After completing the game at least once, you will be able to activate certain tricks.
Open up the browser's console (right click + "Inspect". Select the "Console" subtab if
not already selected) then type in "neatTricks" to get a list of cheat codes.  Keep in
mind that all codes are case and symbol-sensitive, except for the quotations.

Honestly, these codes are the only reason why I don't completely despite this game and
only mostly hate it. If I can't change your mind on playing this game, I would recommend
playing through the end to get to these.
