# Runnable Chance Calculator (v1.1)

This is a program that calculates probability, and comes pre-programmed with data relevant to the answer.  This is a linkable alternative to my previous Chance Calculator that needed to be downloaded.

This is a former shinychance calculator I programmed a little while ago, but have adapted to handle similar calculations.  Pretty much, it takes a percentage or fraction value for the likelyhood of something happening (like a 1/4096 chance to encounter a shiny) and a number of attempts, then calculates the chance of said circumstance happening once for the given number of attempts.  For example, if you try to find, say, a female pidgey, and encounter 2 pidgeys, there is a 75% chance of one of them being female.

This calculator can find all sorts of stuff like that.  I may end up using this occasionally to support answers on PKDB, so I've optimized it to be as flexible as possible.
