# KRLW890's linkable programs

<a href="https://github.com/KRLW890/krlw890.github.io/">Source code</a>

I'm just using this as a place where I can post programs and link them to wherever I might need them.  As such, this repository consists of several different, unrelated programs such as:

(Pokemon)<br>
A type combination calculator, capable of finding the weaknesses, resistances, and immunities of a Pokemon with any number of type combinations: <a href="https://krlw890.github.io/pkdb-answers/type_combos.html">krlw890.github.io/pkdb-answers/type_combos.html</a>

A very primitive Chance Calculator. Finds the chance of things happening after a certain number of attempts. While not strictly related to Pokemon, I included it here because Pokemon deals with a lot of that: <a href="https://krlw890.github.io/pkdb-answers/Chance-Calculator.html">krlw890.github.io/pkdb-answers/Chance-Calculator.html</a>
 
Finds the weaknesses of all possible triple-type combinations achievable via Forest's Curse and Trick-Or-Treat. Not too interesting, other than providing evidence for an answer on PKDB: <a href="https://krlw890.github.io/pkdb-answers/forests_curse_trick_treak_effectiveness.html">krlw890.github.io/pkdb-answers/forests_curse_trick_treak_effectiveness.html</a>

Finds all Pokemon with stats mirrored over Physical and Special stats, once again to find an answer for a database question: <a href="https://krlw890.github.io/pkdb-answers/pkmn-w-mirror-stats.html">https://krlw890.github.io/pkdb-answers/pkmn-w-mirror-stats.html</a>

An edited version of the above program that finds all Pokemon who switch from a higher atk to spa stat upon evolution, and vise versa (database answer): <a href="https://krlw890.github.io/pkdb-answers/pkmn-evos-w-stat-swaps.html">https://krlw890.github.io/pkdb-answers/pkmn-evos-w-stat-swaps.html</a>

Another edited version of the above that finds all Pokemon who keep some stats from their previous form after they evolve (another database answer): <a href="https://krlw890.github.io/pkdb-answers/pkmn-evos-w-same-stats.html">https://krlw890.github.io/pkdb-answers/pkmn-evos-w-same-stats.html</a>

Finds the Hidden Power types of all possible even/odd IV combinations (database answer): <a href="https://krlw890.github.io/pkdb-answers/hptypes.html">https://krlw890.github.io/pkdb-answers/hptypes.html</a>

Finds all the Pokemon that have equal points in each of their stats: <a href="https://krlw890.github.io/pkdb-answers/pkmn-equal-stats.html">https://krlw890.github.io/pkdb-answers/pkmn-equal-stats.html</a>

Generates 6 letters whose scrabble values all add up to the same value. Made for a tournament on the Database: <a href="https://krlw890.github.io/pkdb-answers/random_letter_generator_balanced.html">https://krlw890.github.io/pkdb-answers/random_letter_generator_balanced.html</a>

(Not Pokemon)<br>
A friendly game of chess. Nothing too impressive: <a href="https://krlw890.github.io/Chess/Chess.html">krlw890.github.io/Chess/Chess.html</a>

The same game of chess, except that there are only Knights: <a

Uh, I guess I'll just sort of... uh... leave this... here: <a href="https://krlw890.github.io/nakkadile/play.html">krlw890.github.io/nakkadile/play.html</a>
