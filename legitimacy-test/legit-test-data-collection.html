  <h1>I'm making a Pokemon Legitimacy Test, and I need help gathering information.</h1>
  
  <p>Even with the vast collection of pre-made Pokemon libraries available on the web, I still need to gather some information by hand, and I need a LOT of information.<br>
     Right now, I'm working on making a library I can use to determine which Pokemon are legal in which Pokeballs. Here's how it works:<br><br>
     I've made a simple program for easy data gathering, available <a href="https://krlw890.github.io/legitimacy-test/pokemon_location_form.html">here</a>. When opened, it will ask you what generation you want to start from, and then lead you to a screen that looks something like this:</p>
  <img src="screenshot-1.png" width="70%">
  
  <p>Here's what I need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><i>Unless otherwise specified,</i> please exclude all events and NPC link trades. They come with additional information that this library doesn't need to address.</strong>
    <li>"Wild" should be true if the Pokemon can be fought and captured normally in the wild in <i>ANY</i> of the games indicated by the column. What you're looking for here is whether the Pokemon can be captured by any Pokeballs regularly available in those games. As such, this includes stationary and roming legendaries, but excludes Pokemon only catchable in the Safari Zone or Johto's Bug-Catching Contest. This should also include Pokemon that evolve from Pokemon who meet this qualification, since they can legally have these Pokeballs in the indicated games without trading. <strong>Even if an event is required to battle the legendary (ie, Eon Ticket event with Mew), as long as they can be caught with any Pokeball regularly obtainable, they meet this qualification.</strong>
    <li>"Received" should be true if the Pokemon can't be found normally in the wild, but can be obtained as gifts to the player in a standard Pokeball. ie, the starters, Game Corner prizes, etc.
    <li>"Safari" should be true if the Pokemon can be caught in the Safari Zone or Great Marsh.
    <li>"Sport" should be true if the Pokemon can be caught in Johto's Bug-Catching Contest. GSC and HGSS only.
    <li>"Dream" should be true if the Pokemon can be caught in the Dream World. BW/B2W2 only.
  </ul>
  
  <p>The data gathering program is designed to work with one generation at a time. When done, the program will construct a file with the information you inputted. Download this file and email it to me at krlw890@outlook.com.<br>
     In case I haven't scared you off yet, and you're still interested in helping, <a href="https://krlw890.github.io/legitimacy-test/pokemon_location_form.html">here's another link to the data gathering program</a>.<br>
     Before you start, please contact me on <a href="https://pokemondb.net/pokebase/user/KRLW890/wall">my wall</a> with which generation you want to work on. I would recommend doing Gen 6 or 7. I want to do the older (and, by extension, more complex) generations, since they're more likely to have complications I haven't yet considered, which I would like to personally adress. Plus, it means less work for you.<br><br>
     Here's what's already done:</p>
  <table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>Gen 1</th>
        <th>Gen 2</th>
        <th>Gen 3</th>
        <th>Gen 4</th>
        <th>Gen 5</th>
        <th>Gen 6</th>
        <th>Gen 7</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th>Progress:</th>
        <th class="completed">Completed</th>
        <th class="started">Started<br>(KRLW890)</th>
        <th class="not-started">Not Started</th>
        <th class="not-started">Not Started</th>
        <th class="not-started">Not Started</th>
        <th class="not-started">Not Started</th>
        <th class="not-started">Not Started</th>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>
  
  <p>Please contact me on my wall if you have any questions. <strong>Thank you so much for your help! If you'd like, I will give you credit on the final legitimacy test program.</strong></p>
